# JokeBook
Life is a joke. Here is the book of life. 

## The project
This project contains the source code of the best book in the world: my joke book.  
Written in LaTeX, it allows a professional presentation for a not-so-professional content (except during coffee breaks or for tedious meetings).  

### History
One day, an high-school friend, tired of listening to my jokes, suggested me jokingly that I should write a book. But I took it literally and *voil√†*. 

### The format
At first, it was a Word document (I still got it somewhere in a Dropbox account). Because I quit Windows for Linux, I was unable to maintain properly such a document. I wanted something that can be edited from anywhere (e.g. a terminal) with a nice look. 

Today, some books that I printed are circulating. Please do not attribute to yourself my work (unless you gently ask me). 

## Are the jokes all from yourself? 
Yes. If there are jokes you already know, it is either an adaptation from a more famous joke or a joke I did not know it existed.  

## Can I print it? 
For you and your friends/family: yes! You can share it in PDF too. 
For an editor or for publishing it, ask me before please (without asking me, no). 

## Why don't you publish this? You can be rich and famous!
I highly doubt an editor might accept this (they may think it is a joke).  
Even if a daredevil editor accepts it, I don't expect to make a fortune from that (be realistic: some really good authors hardly earns tenths of euros, although they write books as a living). 
And if there is a copyright infringement (not the case in theory but we never know!), I don't want to have big trouble by involving money in the case.  

One thing that will be sure: **the PDF** (and the future versions of it) **will stay free!**

## Are the information in puns true?
I am neither a mathematician, nor a geographer nor an historian. Do NOT take every word of this book as an absolute truth (you should notice when the information is phony). Footnotes try to explain some things but are not perfect (as well: if you have suggestions, post an issue). 

## How can I contribute?
Thank you for your interest. You can contribute (and after a quick review and a few laughs), I will add it to the project. Here are more information.  

### Credits
I don't want to attribute your work so I will mention your username/GitHub name (if you wish) at the end of the joke. Maybe, if there a lot of contributors, a special page will be added in the end of the book! 

### How to do it
By editing the LaTeX file. You can copy the syntax on the other lines (even without knowing LaTeX, you should be able to write a lot of things -- otherwise, let me know :)).  
If you want to add a chapter or integrate it to existing chapters, let me know!    

### Project structure
There will be three different branches: 
- the master (`main`) with the latest additions
- a release (`contributors-release`) with OUR jokes (contributors and mine)
- another release (`bob-jokes-release`) with only my jokes, if I want to release something more personal. 

### Jokes not accepted
To keep the document acceptable for a wide audience, some jokes are not accepted: 
- Jokes about religions
- Jokes that target people in particular (ethnic group, blonde people, a religion, Belgians, etc) or racism
- Jokes that may be controversial: except for the last two chapters, would it be acceptable to tell it to your children or to your mother? 

## I saw a joke that I dislike: what can I do?
There are two parts that might not please everyone here (the sections without page numbers). If you want to give this to children, you should "forget" to print them. You can also send me a message and the questionable content can be removed.   
I do NOT want to add racists puns (for jokes aiming at some nations, it is only for the name of the city/country, NOT the culture/population/history related to this place). 
*In brief: you can tell me if you find a joke offensive (with suggestions for correcting it, if you wish). If it is really offensive, tell me and it will be deleted. I don't want to offense anybody. Sorry!*

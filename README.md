# JokeBook
Life is a joke. Here is the book of the life. 

## The project
This project yields the source code of the best book in the world: my joke book.  
Written in LaTeX, it allows a professional presentation for a not-so-professional content (except during coffee breaks or for tedious meetings).  

### History
One day, an high-school friend, tired of listening to my jokes, suggested me jokingly that I write a book. But I took it litteraly and *voilÃ *. 

### The format
At first, it was a Word document (I still got it somewhere in a Dropbox account). Because I quit Windows for Linux, I was unable to continue to maintain such a document. I wanted something that can be edited from anywhere (e.g. a terminal) with a nice look. 

Today, some books that I printed are circulating. Please do not attribute to yourself my work (unless you gently ask me). 

## Are the jokes all from yourself? 
For a huge part (>80%): yes. The remainder are either an adaptation from a more famous joke or a joke I did not know it existed.  

## Can I print it? 
For you and your friends/family: yes! You can share it in PDF too. 
For an editor or for publishing it, ask be before (without asking me, no). 

## Why don't you publish this? You can be rich and famous!
I highly doubt an editor might accept this.  
Even if a daredevil editor accepts it, I don't expect to make a fortune from that book (be realistic: some really good authors hardly earns tenths of euros, although they write books as a living). 
And if there is a copyright infringement (not the case in theory but we never know!), I don't want to have big trouble by involving money in the case.  

One thing that will be sure: **the PDF** (and the future versions of it) **will stay free!**

## Are the information in puns true?
I am neither a mathematician, nor a geograph nor an historian. Do NOT take every word of this book as an absolute truth (you should notice when the information is phony). Foornotes try to explain some things but are not perfect (as well: if you have suggestions, post an issue). 

## I saw a joke that I dislike: what can I do?
There are two parts that might not please everyone here (the sections without page numbers). If you want to give this to children, you should "forget" to print them. You can also send me a message and the questionnable content can be removed.   
I do NOT want to add racists puns (for jokes aiming at some nations, it is only for the name of the city/country, NOT the culture/population/history related to this place). 
*In brief: you can tell me if you find a joke offensive (with suggestions for correcting it, if you wish). If it is really offensive, tell me and it will be deleted. I don't want to offense anybody. Sorry!*
